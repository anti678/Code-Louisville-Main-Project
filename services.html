Our practice specializes in a wide array of cosmetic dentistry procedures, including bonding, crowns, and veneers, and we aim to give you the dazzling results you want.

                    <p>Twice-daily brushings and regular flossing are excellent for maintenance between office visits, but a healthy mouth and beautiful smile require routine general and preventative care to stay that way. Our practice offers general care that includes regular oral examinations and cleanings. Our preventative care includes fluoride, sealant, and periodontal (gum disease) treatments designed to help you maintain your smile’s health and beauty.

                        <p>A smile can be dulled by stained, chipped, cracked, or misaligned teeth, but bonding can quickly and painlessly restore your smile’s natural beauty. During the procedure, a thin coating of plastic or resin is painted over the damaged teeth, strengthening them and making them virtually indistinguishable from natural teeth.

Veneers, which are made of thin, customized material designed to slide over the teeth, look incredibly natural, are long lasting, and are relatively easy to apply.

Dr. Carroll may suggest a surgical procedure to you for treatment of your teeth, gums, soft tissues, joints, or jaws. He will refer you to a specialist, if he feels it is in your best interest.

                        <p>Today’s technology allows us to fully customize dentures to fit your mouth precisely and to exactly match the color of your existing teeth. A good fit ensures chewing comfort and added strength. Removable or partial dentures fill gaps left by missing teeth. Partial dentures are held in place with metal clasps or precision devices (tooth-colored, discreet clasps) that are attached to natural teeth. Usually made of resin or metal, partial dentures allow more comfortable and effective chewing, improve speech, and prevent sagging of the cheeks and lips. To find out if partial dentures are right for you, please contact our practice today.</p>

                        <p>Dental Implants offer an amazing solution to missing teeth. Implant dentistry is the most advanced therapy available to replace teeth, or even a single tooth. Not only do they look and feel like real teeth, but dental implants allow you to enjoy the function and confidence of natural teeth. A dental implant is a small titanium screw or cylinder which is surgically placed in the jawbone.The implant replaces the root of the missing tooth, providing an anchor for your new tooth/teeth. The end result is a strong, secure tooth that is virtually indistinguishable from natural teeth. Because dental implants require surgery, they are intended only for candidates with sufficient bone and healthy gums. For more information about dental implants, please contact us today.

                    Similar to fillings, inlays and onlays fill cavities and other areas of trauma or decay in the teeth. They are also called indirect fillings. Unlike regular fillings, however, which are composed of a soft material that is molded into the tooth during the dental visit, indirect fillings are shaped in a dental lab and then firmly cemented into place by the dentist. Inlays fit into a cavity, while onlays lay on top of the tooth to build up a damaged cusp. They are generally much more durable and longer lasting than regular fillings. If you are interested in finding out more about inlays or onlays, please contact us today.

                        <p>Also called caps, crowns are natural-looking covers that fit snugly over teeth to conceal cracked, badly discolored, injured, or chipped teeth. Crowns will minimize physical discomfort in teeth and provide support to damaged or weakened teeth. Ultimately, crowns can improve the overall appearance of your smile while making your teeth more resistant to injury. For more information about crowns, please contact us today.

                        <p>We see many children whose upper and lower jaws are improperly positioned or whose top jaws are too narrow, causing a cross bite. To correct such problems, we rely on removable and fixed orthodontic appliances, such as functional appliances and interceptive expansion appliances. Functional appliances correct upper and lower alignment, ultimately correcting the patient’s bite. Conversely, interceptive expansion appliances widen the upper arch, which is naturally supposed to be wider than the bottom arch. We see many adult patients who have uncorrected bite/alignment problems, have experienced bite collapse due to missing teeth, and have crowded teeth. Oftentimes, orthodontic correction can greatly improve one's quality of life from a functional, as well as esthetic, standpoint. To learn more about these treatment options, please contact us today.

                        <p>Sports are advantageous for many reasons – they’re fun, they build teamwork skills, they offer excellent cardiovascular benefits, and they are great to watch. But many types of sports can put participants at risk for a dental injury, whether that is cracking a tooth, losing a tooth, or even breaking the jaw. Dr. Carroll can custom design a sports guard to fit your mouth by taking a cast model of your teeth. This guard, which covers your upper teeth, is the best option available for protecting your mouth from sports-related injuries. They are custom made, which means they are comfortable and won't interfere with breathing and speaking. Contact us today to find out about getting a custom sports mouth guard made for you or your children.

                    <p>Sometimes a bit more work is needed to give you the smile you want. If you are missing teeth, having trouble speaking or chewing, or are noticing strain when biting, bridges may be the ideal procedure to help make your mouth healthy and beautiful again. Bridges, sometimes referred to as fixed partial dentures, literally bridge gaps between teeth by filling them with strong, natural-looking, artificial teeth. Bridges are semi-permanent – they can only be removed by a dentist – and are comfortable and can strengthen teeth. To find out if bridges are the right option for you, please contact us today.

                    <p>Unfortunately, periodontal (gum) disease can lead to more than just an unsightly smile – it can cause loss of teeth, and eventually, if left untreated, serious health problems. Called gingivitis in its early stages, periodontal disease is caused by excessive toxic bacteria (found in plaque) that attack your mouth’s soft tissues. Using a variety of non-surgical techniques, we can help you reverse the damage caused by periodontal disease and restore your mouth to a healthy, beautiful state. For more information, please contact our office today.</p>

                        <p>Snoring can not only disturb the quality of sleep for both snorers and their partners, but it can also, in more severe cases, be dangerous. Snoring appliances are custom-fit mouth devices that can significantly reduce the level of snoring. They work by moving the lower jaw into a more forward position. This, in turn, increases the airflow space through the mouth and throat and decreases air friction and vibration. The result is a quieter and more restful night’s sleep for all involved. If you or someone you know is interested in learning more about snoring appliances, please contact us today.

                                Splints, Night Guards)</strong></h3>
                        <p>Excessive clenching, grinding, or poor bite alignment can strain your jaw joints and jaw musculature, or injure your teeth, causing discomfort and, often, severe pain. As the condition worsens, dizziness, ear pain, head and neck pain, chewing difficulties, muscle soreness, and even throat pain may surface. To correct such problems, we offer a variety of removable bite guards to help restore balance between the teeth, muscles, and joints. When worn, these guards prevent teeth from touching one another, ultimately relaxing the jaw muscles and alleviating pain. To learn more about our splints and night guards, please contact our practice today.
