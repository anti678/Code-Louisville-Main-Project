# Code-Louisville-Main-Project
Code Louisville project

This project is the first one I have worked on for front-end development. I am in Code Louisville, and decided I would build a mobile friendly website for my dad's local dentistry. He already had a website, but he wanted one more up to date and on-demand that is better accesible by mobile devices such as tablets and cell phones.

It is by no means finished, and he will want me to update it to include my sisters new business she just bought that is also a local dentistry. And also some new practices they have as well as some existing ones I haven't had the time to mention yet. But I plan on finishing it soon with my dad and sister helping me add any finishing touches they'd like to see.
